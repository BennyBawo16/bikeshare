# Bikeshare Project

Welcome to the **Bikeshare Project**, an interactive Python program that analyzes bikeshare data from three major cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. This project is part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program.

## Project Overview

The Bikeshare Project is designed to provide users with insights and statistics about bikeshare usage patterns in the three cities mentioned above. By utilizing this Python program, users can interactively explore various aspects of the data, such as popular stations, trip durations, user demographics, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Bikeshare Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. This project was developed using Python 3, so it's recommended to use a compatible version.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's directory.

4. Run the `bikeshare.py` script using the following command:
   ```
   python bikeshare.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the program is running, you will be prompted to choose a city and specify filters for analyzing the data. You can select a city by typing its name and then customize your analysis by specifying a month or day of the week.

The program will then provide you with various statistics based on your selections, including:

- The most common month, day of the week, and hour for trips
- The most common start and end stations
- The total trip duration and average trip duration
- User demographics (user types, gender distribution, birth year)

## Data Sources

The data used for this project is provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States. The data is pre-processed and included in the project repository for your convenience.

## Project Structure

The project repository includes the following files:

- `bikeshare.py`: The main Python script that interacts with users and analyzes the data.
- `chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv`, `washington.csv`: CSV files containing bikeshare data for each city.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.
